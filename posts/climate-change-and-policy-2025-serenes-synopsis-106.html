<p>Reducing the effects of global warming requires significant changes in global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Decreasing emissions requires a change in the organizations and individuals responsible for their production, which is not realistic without outside force. Companies have no reason to use compostable packaging or clean energy if the only result is a negative impact on their profit margins. Individuals can send a message to corporations by purchasing products only from brands with sustainable practices, but as costs of living rise and citizens remain unconcerned about the threat of climate change, most consumers’ spending habits have not changed. However, companies can also be held accountable for their warming impact by government policy such as carbon credits and legal repercussions, which motivate organizations to act in defense of the future of Earth and its inhabitants.</p>
<p>Incentivizing brands to lower emissions is just one example of the impacts of environmental policy. Federal and state governments have the power to mandate climate education, sponsor environmental research, and protect wild areas from oil drilling projects. Assessing one’s climate footprint and holding corporations accountable are crucial, but the immense potential of policy makes it a key focus in the fight against global warming.</p>
<p>Environmental policy has been a major focus of current US President Donald Trump, who entered office on January 20 of this year. Trump pulled the US out of the Paris climate agreement on his first day in office, an international pledge to prevent global temperatures from rising above 1.5°C from pre-industrial levels. This treaty, adopted by 196 Parties globally, requires nations to devise actionable climate plans to limit their contributions to global warming. These actions are critical, especially as global temperatures are already pushing 1.3°C above temperatures at the end of the Industrial Revolution. The US is the only country to leave the agreement, which first happened during Trump’s 2016 term before Biden reinstated the country during his administration. </p>
<p>In addition to backing out of the Paris agreement, Trump also signed the “Unleashing American Energy” executive order on his first day in office, ordering the freezing of all funds involved in the <a href="https://sereneislearning.wordpress.com/2022/09/11/the-new-climate-bill-the-inflation-reduction-act-serenes-synopsis-6/">Inflation Reduction Act</a>. This includes $8.4 billion in tax credits for clean energy and energy efficiency. Energy production makes up a staggering 73% of global GHG emissions, yet Trump pushes for the advancement of fossil fuels and desertion of clean energy. In just a few weeks, he has approved fossil fuel projects, overturned bans, resumed cancelled projects, and “vowed to end tax credits for renewables,” despite declaring a national energy emergency. Trump’s affinity for fossil fuels is attributed to the $75 million donated by the industry during his presidential campaign in exchange for his support.</p>
<p>Trump is also crushing federal funding for environmental action. His administration is calling for a 65% reduction in funding for the Environmental Protection Agency, and threats to federal research funding has fired scientists and cancelled annual research programs, which investigate scientific methods to tackle the climate crisis in efficient and novel ways. Research is the foundation of technological advancement, and eliminating funding not only halts innovation, but also deprives emerging scientists of essential work and experience, abruptly forcing them to search for other work in unfamiliar fields.</p>
<p>In addition to federal changes, the current administration is impeding on state and city climate projects. This includes plans to override California’s upcoming ban on the sale of gas vehicles by 2035 and threatening public transportation programs by rescinding approval and conducting invasive investigations.</p>
<p>The implications of the new US administration are widespread and significant, especially when it comes to climate action. The chaos of politics push many away, but when the stakes are so high, it is crucial to pay attention to issues like these. </p>
<p>Whether it’s calling your elected officials, donating to environmental organizations, or simply exercising your right to vote in the next election, I urge you to make decisions as an individual with so much power to defend this planet. Climate change has permanent and severe repercussions, and the longer we wait to consider them, the worse they will be. Already, people are losing their homes from fires and their crops from droughts brought on by climbing temperatures, and we haven’t even reached the 1.5°C threshold we are on track to exceed. </p>
<p>This is not the first time I’ve discussed political topics on this website, but I find it important to reiterate that avoiding topics just because of their political associations is foolish. Policy is one of the largest factors affecting anthropogenic emissions, and that should not be ignored. Thanks for reading, and stay tuned to learn with me!</p>
