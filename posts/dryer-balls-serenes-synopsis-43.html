<p>Dryer sheets add a layer of chemicals to clothing, and that slimy residue makes clothing feel softer. However, this builds up after several loads, and can cause children’s clothing to be less fire resistant, towels to be less absorbent, hinder the moisture-wicking capabilities of athletic wear. Wool dryer balls don’t have any of these issues, but can still make clothing feel soft because of their abrasive nature. </p>
<p>Wool dryer balls decrease drying time by absorbing moisture and preventing wet laundry from bundling and twisting together, separating different articles and allowing more air to circulate. They can reduce drying time by 30-50% and decrease static and wrinkles. Most wool dryer balls can be reused up to a thousand times, saving money on lint sheets and reducing waste. Dryer balls are unscented, unlike sheets, so they are a great option for those who are irritated by artificial fragrances. However, for those who enjoy the fragrance, a few drops of essential oil can be added to the balls, allowing individuals to customize the scent of their laundry perfectly to their preference. </p>
<p>Tennis balls have been used as a substitute for dryer balls, but since they aren’t made with plastics that are engineered to endure high temperatures, they’re not recommended. </p>
<p>Over time, the dryer balls will become worn out due to the dry and hot conditions they have endured. washing them on warm with a load of laundry and then putting them through the dryer will restore them. They can be moisturized with this process several times before they begin to fall apart and should be replaced. Instead of throwing them out, though, if they’re 100% wool, they can be composted, or add some essential oil to them and store them in drawers or other compartments to spread a pleasant aroma. </p>
<p>Dryer balls are more efficient and effective than dryer sheets, have a variety of functions, and don’t produce as much waste or cost as much. Those who use lint sheets should seriously consider buying some dryer balls instead, as they decrease drying time and wrinkles, prevent static, cost less, and have a smaller environmental burden. </p>
<p>I didn’t know dryer balls were so great! I knew they were an eco-friendly alternative to dryer sheets because they don’t produce as much waste, but I didn’t know about all their other attributes like dramatically reduced drying time and stuff. My stepmom has gone through a few sets of them but we’ve switched back to dryer sheets, but I doubt she knew how to rejuvenate them. I’ll have to let her know! </p>
<p>I might know a certain someone with access to wool balls. In fact, she doesn’t always know what to do with all her wool balls. Maybe she could give them to people for their dryers. I don’t know, maybe she’d have to treat them first. </p>
<p>She’s the reason I’ve done this article on this subject and not super hot rock energy; she wanted to know about consumer choices that affect the environment. Well she got what she wanted, and next week I’ll get what I want. Or I’ll write about the plague. Who knows, but stay tuned to learn with me!</p>
