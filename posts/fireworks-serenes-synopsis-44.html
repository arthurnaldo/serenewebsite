<p>Fireworks are used to celebrate Independence Day and show pride for the US. However, they actively disturb many of the aspects that represent the nation, including its veterans, environment, and bald eagles. </p>
<p>Fireworks are used to celebrate Independence Day and show pride for the US. However, they actively disturb many of the aspects that represent the nation, including its veterans, environment, and bald eagles. </p>
<p>According to the CPSC (Consumer Product Safety Commission), in 2022, 10,200 people were sent to emergency rooms because of injuries they sustained due to fireworks. In 2022, 43% of fireworks tested by the CPSC contained illegal substances, which have the capacity to severely injure people. They can also cause lung issues and increase vulnerability to respiratory infections, along with heart attacks in those with heart disease. </p>
<p>Fireworks accelerate global warming and contaminate the air, water, and soil. In the US, fireworks emit 60,340 tons of carbon annually, and contain perchlorates that dissolve and contaminate water. The ingestion of perchlorates can decrease thyroid hormone production, which is critical for the growth of the nervous system. Additionally, the nitrogen and sulfur found in many fireworks can combine with oxygen and form nitric and sulfuric acids, which are highly challenging for the respiratory system.</p>
<p>Fireworks are given their color by the addition of various metal salts, which are dispersed in the air after combustion and pollute the air, water, and soil. Fireworks from other countries often contain lead, and although they’re illegal in the US, many of the fireworks distributed to unknowing communities contain illegal substances. </p>
<p>Fireworks distress veterans, people with tinnitus and ASD, and animals. It is foolish and selfish to traumatize veterans who fought for the country and were left with PTSD and call it patriotism. They alarm both domestic and wild animals, disorienting birds and causing them to crash into structures and abandon their nests. These effects led a suburb in Seattle to relocate and reduce the volume of their fireworks display in order to avoid bothering a local bald eagle nest.</p>
<p>Fireworks are unsafe, terrible for the environment, and torment innocent people and animals. There are many ways to celebrate Independence Day that don’t include purchasing these colorful bombs. Enjoying a barbecue and a movie with friends and family can serve as an effective substitute for this destructive habit, but if it’s an event that can’t be missed, it’s always possible to attend others’ firework shows and watch without contributing to it. Additionally, drone shows are a developing alternative to fireworks, offering an enticing view of colorful bright lights in the sky without the downsides associated with normal fireworks shows.</p>
<p>I really should have written this episode last week, but I honestly didn’t really grasp how close it was to the fourth. Not only did I write it in advance, but Scotland obviously lacks the brazen advertisements and stands I was accustomed to. So although I was a little late this year, please keep this information in mind when you consider buying fireworks for next year’s celebration. </p>
<p>I was really inspired to write this because of a podcast episode of The Jordan Harbinger Show about fireworks, and I used its resources to build this Synopsis. Next week we’ll look at superhot rock energy. I know it for certain because I’m about to write it; I’ll be in Paris next Sunday and won’t exactly have time to research and write next episode. What an exciting summer! Anyways, thanks for reading and stay tuned to learn with me!</p>
