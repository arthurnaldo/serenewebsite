<p>With increasing interest in sustainable energy sources such as biofuels, there is a high demand for crops that produce high quantities of oil. To meet this demand and offer a net-zero energy source, scientists have used biotechnology to create GM plants that produce elevated levels of lipids. One type of plant being considered for biodiesel production is <em>Camelina sativa</em>, which is a closely related to canola.</p>
<p>Researchers working with oil-producing crops noticed that yellow seeds tend to produce more oil than other varieties, as the proteins responsible for seed pigments affect oil production. TT8 is a protein that regulates production of certain compounds that determine if a seed appears brown, but it also prevents the activation of genes involved in oil production. Since camelina seeds are usually brown, researchers decided to observe the effect of removing the TT8 gene to maximize oil production. Camelina is hexaploid, meaning it has six sets of DNA, so CRISPR/Cas9 was used to deactivate the TT8 gene in different sets and the resulting seeds were analyzed. The researchers found that only the seeds without all six copies of the TT8 gene had a yellow coat color, and they had a significant increase in oil production without any detriment to protein or starch levels. This GM version of <em>Camelina sativa</em> produces 21.4% more oil than its non-GM counterpart, and this seemingly modest increase has major implications when cultivated on a large scale. The amount of oil made from this genetic change can be used to feed more people or provide sustainable electricity at a lower cost. </p>
<p>Another study was able to increase <em>Camelina sativa</em> productivity by modifying expression of the myosin XI gene. Myosin is a type of motor protein, which converts stored chemical energy into mechanical energy by breaking down ATP. Myosin XI plays a role in cytoplasmic streaming by moving elements of the cytoskeleton, and more rapid cytoplasmic streaming can mean higher productivity.  By altering the expression of a myosin gene, the researchers found an “increase of seed yield and the growth promotion of stems and leaves” (“Success in Promoting Plant Growth for Biodiesel”). This discovery is also effective in other types of plants, meaning it could be used for other methods of food production or CO2 sequestration. </p>
<p>Combining the findings of both studies would create a type of camelina that is more prolific and efficient at producing oil, which would decrease the cost of production and make clean energy more accessible.</p>
<p>Been a while since I’ve covered biofuels, and I thought this was a really fascinating approach. It looks like camelina is a rising crop in agriculture, so editing it for favorable traits would boost its success as we learn more about its possible applications. As I am constantly reminded, there are countless ways to manipulate our food to solve issues like food insecurity and sustainable energy. </p>
<p>I love how this discovery was made because farmers noticed a correlation in seed color and oil production. Not only does this reiterate the vast possibilities of genetic modification, but also the mysteries of gene expression and how a gene for one trait can hugely impact another. I wonder how our technology will advance so we can predict these sorts of things, instead of anecdotal evidence fortunately combined with a visible marker. I’ve heard that AI can play a role in this area, specifically in predicting protein structure, but I’ve yet to do my own research on the topic. Perhaps a future Synopsis? Stay tuned to learn with me!</p>
