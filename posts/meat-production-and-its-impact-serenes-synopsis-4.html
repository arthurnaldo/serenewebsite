<p>Many people know that meat production has is a severe contributor to global warming, but few know exactly what that means. </p>
<p>It is estimated that 10-35% of global emissions come from agriculture. The difference between the figures is so extreme because the lower number doesn’t factor in the deforestation and other land use changes that occur because of agriculture. The farming of livestock causes deforestation, desertification, and and overuse of freshwater, and is one of the main greenhouse gas contributors, with notable methane and nitrous oxide emissions.</p>
<p>A factor of the massive amount of greenhouse gas emissions is the “factory” model used for meat production on a mass scale. These “factories” keep hundreds of thousands of animals confined in cramped spaces instead of grazing in fertile areas. Holding these animals to be in such concentrated spaces has increased emissions by forcing them to eat feed full of chemicals instead of naturally-growing plants that humans would not otherwise use. Their manure would fertilize the ground and create a symbiotic balance. However, in the factory model, the massive amount of manure causes water contamination and the transportation of their feed from other countries worsens the problem even further.</p>
<p>Since grass-fed beef is more environmentally friendly, better labeling is crucial to helping customers make responsible and informed purchases. </p>
<p>Beef has the most GHG emissions by a wide margin, and produces significantly more methane than pigs and poultry. Plant-based protein is even more climate-efficient. Use of plant-based meat extenders would be especially practical in sausage and hamburgers. </p>
<p>Not only is meat a huge factor in global warming, but there is stark evidence of a connection between high-meat diets and bowel cancer and heart disease. According to a study researching meat consumption in the UK, cutting meat consumption in half and replacing it with fruit, vegetables, and grain could reduce GHG emissions by 19%, along with saving up to 43,600 deaths every year in the United Kingdom. However, the consequences of the nutritional deficiencies from the reduction of meat and dairy could result in other issues that have yet to be determined.</p>
<p>Overall, there are a lot of factors in meat production that contribute to climate change. Making more responsible purchases, replacing beef with other proteins, and trying to cut down on meat consumption would not only help the planet, but also our bodies. However, it is important to recognize that moderation is key; not everyone is willing to completely change their diets in an instance. There is space in between being a carnivore in a vegan. Even just substituting those beef tacos for chicken or that hamburger for a plant-based patty can make a big difference in the long run.</p>
<p>I’ve heard a lot about meat, especially beef, being terrible for the environment. Naturally, I’ve cut down on my meat consumption, but I wanted to know the details of exactly how meat production could have such a negative impact.</p>
<p>I feel like I’m still being really broad with these synopses, and I haven’t really gotten deep into the specific details I want to learn about. Obviously, this wide coverage is important and still educational, but there are small topics I’ve heard about and want study further. I think that’s what my next few reviews will be about. </p>
<p>I’m not sure how this whole thing is going to work; am I going to stick with certain topics (like the impact of food) for a while until I cover them completely and never touch back on them, or will I bounce around from topic to topic? Right now I want to research every loose idea around this topic, but I’m sure I’ll think of more stuff as time passes. I guess I’ll figure it out.</p>
