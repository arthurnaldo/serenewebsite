<p>Many regions are experiencing the consequences of climate change, and last summer in Vermont, extreme flooding impacted several cities, including its capital, Montpelier. Some consider it to be the most severe natural disaster in the state since 1927, and dealt damage that left businesses devoting time and money to repairing the resulting destruction for several months. This event has motivated lawmakers to hold companies involved in the production or distribution of fossil fuels financially accountable for the damages they’ve contributed to. </p>
<p>Vermont’s moderate Republican governor did not sign the bill, but allowed it to move forward as law, as he acknowledges the damage that has been done to Vermont by climate change, but is concerned about Vermont’s ability to confront the oil industry in legal battle. This law would have Vermont’s treasurer working with the Agency of Natural Resources to estimate how greenhouse gas emissions have hurt Vermont and its citizens from early 1995 to late 2024, including impacts to “public health, natural resources, agriculture, economic development, housing and other areas.” Lobbyists for fossil fuels point out that companies would be punished for its previous actions, which weren’t illegal at that time. It is unclear how the lawsuit will address these concerns, but knowledge of humankind’s affect on global temperatures have been documented and reported on for many decades prior to 1995, meaning that the fossil fuel industry has been knowingly jeopardizing the futures of others for their own financial gain.</p>
<p>Other states are considering similar legal action, so the outcome of this case will play a major role in deciding whether or not other states will present similar cases. If Vermont loses, it will likely discourage other states from standing up against the oil industry, but if Vermont wins, it would send a strong message to the oil industry that corporations cannot destroy the planet that everyone shares without paying for it. One of Vermont’s representatives, Martin LaLonde, who is also a lawyer,[believes] they have a strong case and points out that the costs of the lawsuit are worth it, as action must be taken unless the selfish and destructive behavior exhibited by the fossil fuel industry is expected to continue.</p>
<p>It’s really inspiring to see states finally recognize that the exploitative companies of the oil industry are responsible for negatively impacting the lives of innocent individuals, and should have to pay for the damages they inflict. They will not hesitate to accelerate global warming, and therefore sabotage the futures of others, if it means maximizing their profits.</p>
<p>Vermont could spend the funds it wins from this trial to mitigate the damages done by the extreme weather events that climate change sponsors. I definitely hope they won’t experience any issues in the next four years, and especially not near the University of Vermont… Not that I have any particular reason to care about that…</p>
<p>I’ve been prepping lots of articles in my free time, so buckle up to hear about aviation, arctic apples, attacks on agriculture, and probably some stuff that doesn’t start with the letter A. Stay tuned to learn with me!</p>
